make a browser based game in vibe25/  want to be able to host from github pages. the game should be broswer based and mobile friendly/optimized. lets make a puzzle game where  you flip tiles to make combos and that unlocks extra troops for a army rts

change tile flips, should only give energy if a match, then tiles should clear out wilth animation. and new random ones slide in. so bit of a memory game. get points when get matches

on mobile can see it all, need better mobile layout so never have to scroll and can see battle areas, move battle area to top

tiles dont fit well, overflowwing, make fit in nice grid of 5x5

add a svg of somthing collecting to the tiles, maybe emojis, some 1 cheap plan 3 maybe gold or coins

backgroun of tiles make tan 

change the 2nd image to be food instead of a plant

add in bread and carrots as well, they should have lower power than gold

add cool effects, like whenever you match a card, a fun sound will play.

download some cc0 sounds for fillers for now

get a more subtle sound for normal clicks and use duiff sounds for diff type of combos

now i dont here anything, want a little click oon each tap, something diff for creating each type of soldier, and an appropriate sound for each combo type (coins clinking be good for gold) 

i still dont hear anything, check back to when sounds worked

...bunch of fail downloading, unvibe manual dl...

got sounds, there are 2 playing when get combo only want the per comb sound

could you change the tile bg colors to be more screen safe colors , showing up wierd on some monitors

ugly

ugly, want to look good, and maybe some more gb, more like a game not a biz saas page

lets get a sound and indicator when dont have enough money to buy something

disable text selection on all the cards and buy buttons

no fail sound

i want sound its jsut not working

just fail sound rest was fine

denied not work 

still no denied sound, prob dl blocked again

...unvibe manualdir cleanup...

oh was just in wrong path, i moved it and got rid of extra, but need a better fail sound that one too happy

manual fine

*that a lie, no vibe, manual dl try*

*novibe manual...eh forget its whatever*

wat, it is playing all the sounds first time click, stop that go back

could you add some sort of fun background

way too small and wasteful of space, keep 5x5 match grid as most of area so big buttons easy to click

=====detour reverted =====

add, some of the cards have your troopers hidden in them and if you match all three, you receive the trooper.

=====

lets add new type of match  that is a man, but if you match 3 you get a random troop  instead of power

i cant find any men clicking tiles

found one, but didnt get anything when matched 3

=====
gave a knight each time, is it a random troop?
=====

gave knight every time matched men, should be  random troop; also showing power underined in battelfield

in battele field area dont show cost just emoji and name

no line wrap in battel field cards

start with 10 power

combine your troops of same type in battle field, show count

cattelfield getting chopped make wider

now the avaliable troops area are overlapping

change energe to be gold

add a mini game, whenever you get more than 200 gold have a dragon attack, and you lose 100 gold, and a mini click out the fires game, if dont put out 10 fires fast enough than lose 10 gold for each one you miss

show time countdown on the mini game, show damage report after time ends for 5 more seconds saying he stole 100 and lost another 10x home any firesnot put out in damages

make the time 3 seconds less long, also when i click all the fires out it did 2 popups and subtracted double gold fix that

make the fires each have a 50% change of moving to a random space eavery 2 seconds

add a button by the title chich gives 20 gold every time clicked

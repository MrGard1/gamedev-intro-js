make a browser based game in vibe25/  want to be able to host from github pages. the game should be broswer based and mobile friendly/optimized. lets make a puzzle game where  you flip tiles to make combos and that unlocks extra troops for a army rts

change tile flips, should only give energy if a match, then tiles should clear out wilth animation. and new random ones slide in. so bit of a memory game. get points when get matches

on mobile can see it all, need better mobile layout so never have to scroll and can see battle areas, move battle area to top

tiles dont fit well, overflowwing, make fit in nice grid of 5x5

add a svg of somthing collecting to the tiles, maybe emojis, some 1 cheap plan 3 maybe gold or coins

backgroun of tiles make tan
